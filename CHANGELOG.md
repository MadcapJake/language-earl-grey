# Change Log
All notable releases and changes to this project will be documented in this file. The development of this project is highly iterative so expect frequent patch releases. Minor releases are reserved for my personal opinion on milestones of the project.  I expect near complete syntax coverage by `0.9.0` and all the bells and whistles of an Atom language package by `1.0.0`.

## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2015-05-20
### Added
- Numbers section to `docs.eg`
- Arrays and objects section to `docs.eg`

## [0.4.10] - 2015-05-16
### Added

- arrow functions, some constants and `this` highlighting (thanks @davej )

### Changed
- todo list updated with completed syntax
- structure of `README.md` changed around a bit

### Removed
- repple feature and keybindings from todo list as that will need to be a
  separate package


## [0.4.9] - 2015-05-16
### Changed
- Symbol rule was removed from keyword rule. Gotta find a better selector.
  Another option is not highlighting general symbols (this is probably more
  natural)

### Fixed
- Interpolation looks pretty good now (minus keywords...)

## [0.4.8] - 2015-05-16
### Added
- Pretty `re` file that might not be useful but has helped me work through the
  keyword pattern matching
- More of the docs have been translated to straight EG, up to interpolation

### Changed
- Interpolation now does not show keywords due to current difficulties getting
  it to work
