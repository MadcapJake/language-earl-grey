## [Unreleased][unreleased]
### Added
- changelog file to track changes better
- arrow functions, some constants and `this` highlighting (thanks @davej )
-

### Changed
- todo list updated with completed syntax
- structure of `README.md` changed around a bit

### Removed
- repple feature and keybindings from todo list as that will need to be a separate package


## [0.4.9] - 2015-05-16
### Changed
- Symbol rule was removed from keyword rule. Gotta find a better selector. Another option is not highlighting general symbols (this is probably more natural)

### Fixed
- Interpolation looks pretty good now (minus keywords...)

## [0.4.8] - 2015-05-16
### Added
- Pretty `re` file that might not be useful but has helped me work through the keyword pattern matching
- More of the docs have been translated to straight EG, up to interpolation

### Changed
- Interpolation now does not show keywords due to current difficulties getting it to work
