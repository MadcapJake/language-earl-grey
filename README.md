Adds syntax highlighting, snippets, autocomplete and folding support to [Earl Grey](http://breuleux.github.io/earl-grey/) files in Atom.

## Status

Already a strong set of highlighting rules. Only some of the more advanced functionality has not been implemented. Many of these features would require using deeply nested patterns that someday I hope to implement. For a list of things that I'd like to add, see below. If you're interested in implementing one of these, let me know in gitter or through an issue/PR and I'd love to help.  Also, do give the current package a try and don't forget to let me know what needs fixing!

## Todo

* Syntax Highlighting
  * Function Declarations
  * Pattern matching
  * Regular expressions
  * Document building syntax
  * Async*
  * Classes*
  * macros*
* Snippets
* Autocomplete hooks
* Folding hooks

_*: not sure if these will need any adjustments_

## How can I help?

Get in touch on gitter, submit bugs/ideas, submit pull requests, and use Earl Grey!
